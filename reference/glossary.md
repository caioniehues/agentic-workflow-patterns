# Glossary A-Z

> Complete cross-reference of all agentic terminology

---

## A

**ACI (Agent-Computer Interface)**
: The design layer between AI agents and computer tools. Coined by Anthropic, emphasizing that tool interfaces should be optimized for agent ergonomics (clear documentation, error handling, output structure) not just human usability (HCI).
: *Also known as:* Tool Interface, Agent Tooling Layer

**Agent**
: ⚠️ **Ambiguous term** — can mean:
: 1. **Generic:** Any autonomous AI system (Main Agent, Subagent)
: 2. **Anthropic Pattern #6:** System where LLMs **dynamically direct their own processes** (🐉 Autonomous Agents)
: In Claude Code, the 🐔 Main Agent orchestrates all operations. Contrast Agents (pattern) with Workflows.
: *See also:* Main Agent, Subagent, 🐉 Autonomous Agent

**Agentic Systems**
: Umbrella term for any system using LLMs with tool-calling and control flow. Encompasses both Workflows (predefined orchestration) and Agents (dynamic direction).
: *Also known as:* Agentic Architecture, Autonomous Systems

**AskUserQuestion**
: Tool for human-in-the-loop interactions. Presents structured questions with options to the user. Key component of Wizard Workflows.

```python
AskUserQuestion(questions=[{
    "header": "Confirm",
    "question": "Proceed with migration?",
    "options": [
        {"label": "Yes", "description": "Continue"},
        {"label": "No", "description": "Cancel"}
    ]
}])
```

**🐉 Autonomous Agent**
: An agent that independently plans, executes, and adapts without constant human guidance. The only true "Agent" pattern in Anthropic's taxonomy (vs Workflows).
: *Also known as:* Self-Directed Agent, True Agent

**Augmented LLM**
: The 🦄 Building Block — foundation for all agentic systems. An LLM enhanced with retrieval (RAG/docs), tools (actions), and memory (context persistence).
: *Also known as:* 🦄 Building Block, Enhanced LLM, Tooled LLM
: *See also:* Building Block

**agentId**
: Unique identifier assigned to each subagent execution. Used with `resume` parameter to continue a previous subagent conversation. Agent transcripts are stored as `agent-{agentId}.jsonl`.
: *See also:* resume, Resumable Subagents

---

## B

**🦄 Building Block**
: Anthropic's term for the **Augmented LLM** — the foundational unit of all agentic systems. An LLM enhanced with retrieval, tools, and memory.
: ⚠️ **Not to be confused with:** Claude Code Components (Subagent, Slash Command, Skill, Hook) which are abstractions built ON TOP of the building block.
: *See also:* Augmented LLM
: *See also:* [Building Block Pattern](../concepts/workflows/00-building-block.md)

**Built-in Subagents**
: Pre-configured subagents available out of the box in Claude Code.
: *See:* [Built-in Subagents Reference](built-in-subagents.md)

---

## C

**CLAUDE.md**
: Project instruction file loaded automatically by Claude Code. Part of the State Layer.

**Component**
: Claude Code abstractions for organizing agent capabilities: 🐦 Subagent, 🦴 Slash Command, 📚 Skill, 🪝 Hook.
: ⚠️ **Not to be confused with:** 🦄 Building Block (Anthropic's Augmented LLM concept).

**Context Management**

: The foundation - single augmented LLM call with no orchestration. Pattern #0 in our taxonomy. Fastest execution path.

---

## E

**🩻 Evaluator-Optimizer**
: Anthropic pattern for iterative improvement through generate-evaluate-feedback loops.
: *See:* [Evaluator-Optimizer Pattern](../concepts/workflows/06-evaluator-optimizer.md)

## H

**Hook**
: Shell command or prompt triggered by Claude Code events. Types: `command` (shell) or `prompt` (LLM-based).

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Write",
      "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "npm run lint" }]
    }]
  }
}
```

: *See:* [Hook Component](../implementation/components/hook.md)

**Human-in-the-Loop**
